# Constellation Map: 3D Constellation Explorer âœ¨ðŸŒŒðŸ”­

## Try live demo - [Demo](https://constilition-map.vercel.app/)

An immersive and visually stunning 3D constellation viewer built with React, Vite, and Three.js (@react-three/fiber). Explore the night sky, hover over constellations to see their shapes illuminate, and click to learn more about them.

## Overview

Constellation Map offers an interactive journey through the cosmos right from your browser. Centered around a beautifully textured 3D Earth model, the application renders a dynamic starfield and the major constellations.

Users can freely rotate, zoom, and pan the view. Hovering over the stars of a constellation reveals its familiar shape with highlighted lines and stars. Clicking on a constellation brings up an elegant modal window displaying its name, designation, English name, and other available details from the dataset.

This project emphasizes visual appeal with smooth animations, a dark/light theme toggle, gradient UI elements, and post-processing effects like bloom for a truly "epic" look. It serves as Day **Day 28** of my **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge, showcasing how AI can assist in rapidly prototyping and building visually rich web experiences.

## Features

*   **Interactive 3D Globe:** Central rotating Earth model with day map, normal map, and cloud layer textures.
*   **Immersive Skybox:** Realistic panoramic space background.
*   **Dynamic Starfield:** Thousands of stars rendered using `@react-three/drei`.
*   **Constellation Data Rendering:** Displays stars and faint connecting lines for dozens of constellations based on astronomical data.
*   **Hover Interaction:** Smoothly highlights constellation stars and lines upon hover.
*   **Click Interaction:** Selects a constellation, keeping it highlighted.
*   **Detailed Information Modal:** Displays constellation details (Name, Designation, English Name, Rank, Coordinates) in an animated, styled modal (`framer-motion`).
*   **Theme Toggle:** Switch between default dark mode and a light mode theme.
*   **Visual Effects:** Utilizes bloom post-processing (`@react-three/postprocessing`) for glowing stars and highlights.
*   **Modern UI:** Sleek header and footer with gradients and backdrop blur effects using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Data-Driven:** Constellation positions, lines, and info loaded from local JSON files.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, and Tailwind CSS.

    *   `postprocessing` (Core library)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion (for modal)
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Icons:** `react-icons`
*   **Package Manager:** npm
